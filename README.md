## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D JavaScript library
- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) - React renderer for Three.js
- [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) - Useful helpers for React Three Fiber

## Project Description

This project recreates the iconic visual style of Studio Ghibli's trees in a 3D environment. It uses techniques demonstrated in the tutorial to achieve the painterly, stylized look characteristic of Ghibli films like "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Princess Mononoke".

Key features:
- Custom tree geometry and materials
- Stylized shading techniques
- Ghibli-inspired color palette
- Interactive 3D environment

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
